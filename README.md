# The Last Project in Odin's Advanced HTML and CSS (Homepage)

I just did the header part because I think it's the trickiest one.

Here's the [Project's Link](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-advanced-html-and-css-homepage) on the Odin Project's website.

## Notes

I was just focusing on the layout and getting it to looks as close to the design as possible so no focus on accessibility and performance, also I didn't change the default fonts.

I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons, and sometimes they're being loaded after the page has fully rendered which is causing some rendering issues.
